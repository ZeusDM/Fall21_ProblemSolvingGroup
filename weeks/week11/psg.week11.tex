			Suppose that a polygon has integer coordinates for all of its vertices. Let \(i\) be the number of integer points that are interior to the polygon, and let \(b\) be the number of integer points on its boundary (including vertices as well as points along the sides of the polygon). Then the area of this polygon is \[
				i + \frac{b}{2} - 1.

		Determine whether there exist non-constant polynomials $P\left(x\right)$ and $Q\left(x\right)$ with real coefficients satisfying \[P\left(x\right)^{10}+P\left(x\right)^9=Q\left(x\right)^{21}+Q\left(x\right)^{20}.\]

		Ann and Bob play a game on an infinite checkered plane making moves in turn. A move consists in orienting any unit grid-segment that has not been oriented before. If at some stage some oriented segments form an oriented cycle, Bob wins.
		\begin{enumerate}[label = (\alph*)]
			\item Bob makes the first move. Does Bob have a strategy that guarantees him to win?
